To address the task of fraud detection in financial transactions, we will break down the process into the steps outlined.
Weâ€™ll start with data understanding and preparation, then modeling and evaluation.
Data Understanding
Data Inspection:
Check for missing values.
Check for class imbalance in the target variable (fraud).
Data Summary:
Summary statistics of numerical features.
Distribution of categorical features.
Data Preparation
Handle Missing Values:
Fill or remove missing values.
Address Class Imbalance:
Use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
Feature Engineering:
Create additional features based on transaction history and behavior.
Encode categorical variables if needed.
Data Splitting:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Modeling Techniques:
Try different models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks.
Class Imbalance:
Use techniques like SMOTE during training.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.
Evaluation Metrics:
Use Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC for evaluation.
Objective
Aim for the highest recall to detect as many fraudulent transactions as possible without significantly compromising precision.
